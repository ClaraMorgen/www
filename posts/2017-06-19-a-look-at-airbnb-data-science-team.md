As a consumer company, data represents the voice of Airbnb's users at scale, and Data Scientists play the role of interpreter. Data Scientists at Airbnb face unique challenges due to the dynamics of our two-sided marketplace, the online and offline components of our platform and the vast surface area of our product.
