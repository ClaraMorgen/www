What a hell of a week it has been! For the first time ever we gathered all Le Wagon 57 drivers and teachers from all around the world in the same spot, at the same time. 19 cities representing 12 countries during 4 days, that is something.

## We love Portugal

Digging back into Le Wagon history and DNA it didn’t take us long to agree that Ericeira, Portugal would be the perfect spot for such an event. With its non-stop sunny weather, high quality waves and its maze of small streets packed with the smell of grilling fish and sounds of clinking glasses, this place is an absolute must-go!

But the real treasure of Ericeira is… the Portuguese people. They are among the most welcoming and helpful humans you could dream of. Many thanks to José, our host, and his incredible connections all over the city, also to the local representants who opened us the doors of the Ericeira Business Factory for 2 days, there is no way we could thank you all enough!

## A retreat is the best way to create bonds between people

It may be a bit cliché to assess that Retreat is the best team building event you can pull off into your company, but it actually is. A few weeks ago we were more about Slacking to each other asking for business relevant details than engaging into deep personal talk with our colleagues across the globe. Funny enough, from the beginning Le Wagon is about people. From students to teachers, we’re one united patchwork of individuals coming from various horizons with different goals and passions gathering around a commun appetite for coding and thriving at the idea of building great products. However we never “completely” commit into such a thing on a global scale with our team.

It is now a thing done. At first sight, the magic happened as everyone was really psyched to put a real face on our respective Slack avatars! (hint: the Playa de Ribeira d’Ilhas is surely responsible for that). As soon as everyone landed in Portugal, we gathered the whole crew around a few sangrias and a buffet full of Portuguese specialties while our COO kicked off the event with a speech (while our CTO was enjoying a few waves :D)

From there, it’s been a pure bliss revolving around yoga, surfing, good food and parties with too many smiles to count them all!

## There's even a video to prove it!

## But we were also amazingly serious!

Don’t be fooled by the pictures, half of our time in Ericeira has been dedicated to work. We split our group to make sure everyone gets some proper food for thoughts on their way back home. While the city drivers shared tips and tricks related to their previous experiences, the teachers got back to students’ mode and… just killed it. In less than 5 hours, they built 4 amazing products ready to use on our various platforms and even pulled-off a Demo Day of their own!

We now have a livecode battle platform, a chrome extension enabling the localisation of our documentation examples (quite important to have a real local restaurant name when you are building a ordering system. Yep.), an index of all the companies using Ruby and Ruby on Rails in the countries we are operating in and a nice upgrade of our ticketing system in order to quickly fix minor issues when our students are stuck somewhere. Again. In 5 hours. Big up guys!

## What’s next?

It’s too early to see all the benefits of such an event but only one week later, new connections has been formed, a few trips have been organised to work remotely from a location or another and even more help has been provided or offered than before (which is truly amazing when you already know the level of commitment and care we are all able to deploy from the beginning of this adventure).

Last but not least, be sure that we will do it again next year! We truly don’t know if retreats are the elixir of happiness at work, but for sure, it’s one of it’s main ingredients. So let’s enjoy it without moderation ;)

With love,

Le Wagon team.
